# Array Element Swap Program

This Java program demonstrates a simple array element swapping operation. It swaps two elements in an integer array based on their indices.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the `Swap.java` file to see the demonstration.
3. Modify the `main` method to try swapping elements in different arrays.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different arrays!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
